        "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases that have distinct approaches to data storage, retrieval, and management. Here are some of the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Model: SQL databases use a relational data model, which means that data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships are established between them using foreign keys. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use various non-relational data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-oriented, or graph-based, to store and manage data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Schema: SQL databases have a rigid schema that defines the structure of the data and the relationships between tables. This schema must be designed and created before data can be stored in the database. In contrast, NoSQL databases have a flexible schema that allows data to be added, modified, or removed without a predefined schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "Querying: SQL databases use SQL, a standardized language for querying and manipulating data, to retrieve and modify data. NoSQL databases often have their own query languages that are specific to the data model they use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle larger amounts of data by adding more processing power or storage capacity to a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle larger amounts of data by distributing the load across multiple servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "ACID compliance: SQL databases are typically ACID-compliant, meaning that they support transactions that are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. NoSQL databases can be ACID-compliant or non-ACID compliant, depending on the specific database and data model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and data consistency, while NoSQL databases are often used for applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and speed in handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

The primary key ensures that there are no duplicate rows in the table and provides a way to reference individual rows in the table. By convention, a primary key is usually identified by an \"ID\" column in the table.\n",

In other words, the foreign key in one table must have a corresponding primary key value in the referenced table.\n",
